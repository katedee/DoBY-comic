When initially planning out this comic it wasn't to be in black and white, and so I had to think about how to distinguish clothes of the magic world from the regular world. Pattern-making was my solution, and convenient as it also tied into some of my themes looking at the erosion of distinct slavic culture through Catholic domination. While this didn't strictly happen through pattern-making, much of slavic pagan ritual involved sewing and embroidery, and these patterns were made with specific intention (and that's a kind of ritual).

Little known influence on this comic (and big influence of mine overall) is the movie Children of Men. I am nowhere near as masterful as Cuar√≥n, but I thought of the casual world-building through the environment of that movie (like in the image above, "avoiding fertility tests is a crime") and sought to replicate some of that in this comic-- through signs posted and revealing what items/resources are scarce.
