Again, this is another page where the environmental story-telling of Children of Men inspired me. I wanted a sense of shortage and control/limit of herbs (usually associated with witchcraft).

In completely other news, but worth recommending here: I was reminded of John Berger's [Ways of Seeing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgZCWewreKo&list=PL3WD7al24ZH6Z9ekfpE3q4n5TURYvYz3T) as I recommended it to some friends this weekend. Ways of Seeing was a direct challenge western culture aesthetics, and to challenge viewers to see the messaging and ideologies inherent in art. I really feel like it's mandatory viewing for all folks!
