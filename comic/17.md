This was super fun working out letter for the explosion!

While I have your attention here, I'd like to direct you to [this petition to the House of Commons in Canada](https://www.ourcommons.ca/petitions/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-6695) to deal with consumer protection/stop credit card companies from blocking what we can buy (particularly in regards to nsfw artwork). Even if you don't purchase adult content, something like this is worth paying attention to because what does/doesn't get labelled as pornography or explicit is deeply subjective (as we see now, where near anything lgbtq+ is being targeted).

Credit card companies threaten the livelihood of talented artists every day, and their ban on "offensive" content quickly slips into scary authoritarian bans.
