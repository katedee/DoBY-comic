Did I unnecessarily draw that embroidered pattern by hand? Yes ðŸ˜«

The pattern here, and some of the patterns seen later, are heavily inspired by and lifted from [Polish folk costumes](https://folkcostume.blogspot.com/2013/05/costume-of-western-krakow-region.html), specifically Krakow here (there were regional variances between costumes).
