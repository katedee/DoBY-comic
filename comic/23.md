Work on Chapter 3 begins soon! It has been a rough year, so a late start (usually I begin in August/September). I'm also going to trial going back to traditional mediums (ink, watercolour) even though it will slow down the process considerably. But I currently want to be more slow and intentional with my work. I'm hoping updates won't lag because I still have quite a backlog! I'll update the process as I go in the notes here :)
