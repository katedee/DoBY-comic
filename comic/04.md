This is one of those pages I had fun writing/thumbnailing/imagining, but agonized over the execution. In the end, I wish I had done more and labored a bit more over the pile of body parts. But, I think it still gets the point across!

While I'm here, I'd be remiss to not mention my [newsletter](https://thisiskatedee.beehiiv.com/), which mostly serves as notification for [my blog](https://www.katedee.com/blog). If people end up wanting a seperate newsletter to notify of Baba Yaga updates, I'm open to that in the future, but I do have an [RSS Feed](https://www.babayagacomic.com/feed.xml).
