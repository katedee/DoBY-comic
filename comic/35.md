We're nearing the end of Chapter 1, where I will likely take a month long break between chapters to give me some much needed focus time on any Chapter 2 corrections and working on Chapter 3 ☺️. There are still a few more updates before that, but be sure to stay tuned via the [RSS feed](), or to see when I post about it on my [bluesky]().

If you don't know what an RSS Feed is, [here's a quick primer](https://riverside.com/blog/what-is-an-rss-feed). You don't have to just use it for webcomics, though it is quite handy for that! 

Here are a list of some RSS readers which compile these feeds for your convenience:
- [Feedly](https://feedly.com)
- [Feeder](https://feeder.co/)
- [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/)
- [Newsblur](https://newsblur.com/)

You could also look into setting up your own, but that's a whole other topic and here I'm focusing on y'all who may not be comfy touching some code.
