Hi all!

So excited to put this comic up online! I intended to do this earlier, but all the comic festival circuits got me and overwhelmed me. Plus, I wanted to have a solid backlog to publish while I continued to work on it behind the scenes. I'm hoping to share more behind-the-scenes work and progress as I go, but in the meantime come back here every Monday for another page (aiming to have them up by noon EST).

While I'm here, I'd be remiss to not mention my [newsletter](https://thisiskatedee.beehiiv.com/), which mostly serves as notification for [my blog](https://www.katedee.com/blog). If people end up wanting a seperate newsletter to notify of Baba Yaga updates, I'm open to that in the future, but I do have an [RSS Feed](https://www.babayagacomic.com/feed.xml).
