In Ziespa magic is believed to have been wiped out years ago with the burning of the witch Baba Yaga.
Anyone suspected of using witchcraft is condemned to death.

Vasilisa is the daughter of a rumoured witch. She dreams of squirreling away some funds to live a normal, quiet life far from the stain of magic that follows her around. But while she thinks she can easily let go of her ties to magic, it seems the magic world is not done with her.

The Death of Baba Yaga is a gothic western reimagining of the myth of Vasilisa the Beautiful.
